#Both choices are the same!
Now comes the fun part! We need to create a  
function. It will take two parameters (ie. the  
two choices made) and then return the  
winning choice.

When programming a game like this, you  
have to first figure out all the various  
outcomes. One outcome is that the choice the  
user makes is equal to the choice the  
computer makes.

##Instructions
**01.** We carried over the code from  
the previous section, but it is a comment. Leave it  
there for now.

**02.** Below the comment, declare a function  
called `compare`.

**03.** It takes two parameters, `choice1` and  
`choice2`.

**04.** Inside the function, write an `if`  
statement. *If* `choice1 === choice2, then`  
`return` `"The result is a tie!"`
