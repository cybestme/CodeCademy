#Next Steps
Congratulations on making your awesome  
game! But now comes the best bit. You have  
the skills to build a game of your own design!  
Below are some ideas:

**01.**  
What if a user makes an inappropriate choice  
like 'dog'? How can we extend the function to  
handle that?

**02**  
.What if players in the game could also choose  
Rope in this game?

**03.**  
In this version, if both players make the same  
choice, the game returns a tie. What if the  
game didn't end there but instead asked both  
players for new choices?
