#User Choice
We start by first asking the user which option  
they want to pick. We will later use this choice  
in the compare function to determine the  
winner.
***
**01.** Declare a variable called `userChoice`.

**02.** Make the variable equal to the answer we  
get by asking the user "Do you choose rock,  
paper or scissors?"
