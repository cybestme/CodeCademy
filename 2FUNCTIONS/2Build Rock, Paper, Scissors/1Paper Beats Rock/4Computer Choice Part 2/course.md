#Computer Choice: Part 2
We have `computerChoice` but it now equals a  
random number between 0 and 1. We need  
to somehow translate this random number  
into a random choice of rock, paper, or  
scissors. How do we do this?!

**01.** If `computerChoice` is between 0 and 0.33,   
make computerChoice equal to `"rock"`.

**02.** If `computerChoice` is between 0.34 and  
0.66, make `computerChoice` equal to `"paper"`.

**03.** If `computerChoice` is between 0.67 and 1,   
make `computerChoice` equal to `"scissors"`.

But there are three outcomes! Using `if /`  
`else` only lets us have two outcomes. What  
now?! We need to use `if / else if / else.`  
See the hint for the full syntax. You will laugh  
at how easy it is.

##Instructions
**01.** Under your existing code, write out the `if`  
`/ else if / else` statement.

**02.** In the respective code blocks, change the  
value of `computerChoice` based on the rules  
stated above. Remember, you do NOT have to  
use `var` when changing the value of a  
variable that already exists.
