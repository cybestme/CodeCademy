#Functions recap
Okay let's review. You have learned a lot  
about functions today. We better not forget it  
all!

We first discovered how to use functions to  
perform the same piece of logic repeatedly,  
without having to type the same code again.  
This saves you time!
***
**01.** Write a function called `nameString()`

**02.** It should take `name` as a parameter.

**03.** The function `returns` a string equal to  
`"Hi, I am" + " " + name.`

**04.** Call `nameString()` by passing it your name,  
and use `console.log` to print the output.
