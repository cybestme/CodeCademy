#Don't Repeat Yourself (D.R.Y)
The D.R.Y. principle is really important in  
programming. No repeating!

Any time you find yourself typing the same  
thing, but modifying only one small part, you  
can probably use a function.

The 'small part' that you find yourself  
modifying will be the parameter. And the part  
that you keep repeating will be the code in  
the reusable block - the code inside `{ }`.

##Instructions
You are a creature of habit. Every week you  
buy 5 oranges. But orange prices keep  
changing!

**01.** You want to declare a function that  
calculates the cost of buying 5 oranges.

**02.** You then want to calculate the cost of the  
5 all together.

**03.** Write a function that does this called  
`orangeCost()`.

**04.** It should take a parameter that is the cost  
of an orange, and multiply it by 5.

**05.** It should log the result of   
the multiplication to the console.

**06.** Call the function where oranges each cost  
5 dollars.
