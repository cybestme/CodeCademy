#Functions, return and if / else
When we call a function, its `return` value is  
just the result from running the function. That  
value can then be used just like any other  
value in JavaScript!

Look at the `if` statement starting on line 7.  
The `if` statement is checking whether the  
result of calling the function named `quarter`  
is divisible by 3.

##Instructions
**01.** Define a function called `quarter` which  
has a parameter called `number`.

**02.** This function returns a value equal to one  
quarter of the parameter. (i.e. `number / 4;`)

**03.** Call the function inside the `if` statement's  
**condition** (and put in a parameter value!)  
such that "The statement is true" is printed to  
the console.
