#Return keyword
Nice job! Now, when we call a function, we  
don't always want to just print stuff.  
Sometimes, we just want it to `return` a value.   
We can then use that value (ie. the output  
from the function) in other code. Let's learn  
about the `return` keyword, then we'll see how   
to use functions with an if / else statement in  
the next exercise!

The `return` keyword simply gives the  
programmer back the value that comes out of  
the function. So the function runs, and when  
the `return` keyword is used, the function will  
immediately stop running and `return` the  
value.

##Instructions
In our example we have a function called  
`timesTwo()` that takes in a number and  
returns the number multiplied by two.

**01.** On line 7, after the equals sign, call the   
function `timesTwo` with any parameter you  
want

**02.** Line 8 prints out `newNumber`. Notice how  
the value we `return` from `timesTwo()` is  
automatically assigned into `newNumber`.
