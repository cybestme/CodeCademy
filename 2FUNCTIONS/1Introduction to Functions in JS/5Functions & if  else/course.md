#Functions & if / else
An especially useful application of reusable  
code is `if/else` statements. These can be  
very wordy, and a pain to type repeatedly.

We are going to write a function that checks  
how many hours of sleep a night you're  
getting. Inside the function will be an   
`if/else` statement. We want the function to  
check many different numbers of hours to  
see whether a person is getting enough sleep.

##Instructions
**01.** Write a function named `sleepCheck` that  
takes the parameter `numHours`

**02.** Inside the function, write an `if` statement  
where if the number of hours of sleep is  
greater than or equal to 8, the computer will  
`return "You're getting plenty of sleep! ` 
`Maybe even too much!";.`

**03.** Otherwise (`else`) if the number of hours  
of sleep is less than 8, have the computer  
`return "Get some more shut eye!";`

Then call the function with different hours of  
sleep

**01.** Call the function with 10 hours of sleep,  
like this: `sleepCheck(10);`

**02.** Call the function with 5 hours of sleep.

**03.**` Call the function with 8 hours of sleep.`
