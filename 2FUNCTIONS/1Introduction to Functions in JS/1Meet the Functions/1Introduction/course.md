#Introduction
Programming is simply a way to give  
instructions to the computer.

In Getting Started, we learned about `if / `  
`else` statements.

We want to keep learning ways to instruct the  
computer to perform repeatable tasks  
efficiently.

##Instructions
Let's briefly review! Use an if / else to  
check how fast you're driving.

**01.** If speed is greater than 80, use  
console.log to print "Slow down"

**02.** Otherwise (else), use console.log to print  
"Drive safe"
