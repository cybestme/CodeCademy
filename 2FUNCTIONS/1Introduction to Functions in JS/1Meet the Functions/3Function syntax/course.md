#Function syntax
A function takes in inputs, does something   
with them, and produces an output

Here's an example of a function:

    var sayHello = function(name) {
    console.log('Hello ' + name);
};

**01.** First we declare a function using `var`, and  
then give it a name `sayHello`. The name  
should begin with a lowercase letter and the  
convention is to use lowerCamelCase where  
each word (except the first) begins with a  
capital letter.

**02.** Then we use the `function` keyword to tell  
the computer that you are making a function

**03.** The code in the parentheses is called a  
**parameter**. It's a placeholder word that we  
give a specific value when we call the  
function. Click "Stuck? Get a hint!" for more.

**04.** Then write your block of reusable code  
between `{ }`. Every line of code in this block  
must end with a ;.

You can run this code by "calling" the  
function, like this:

`sayHello("Emily");`

Calling this function will print out `Hello`  
`Emily.`

##Instructions
**01.** On line 11, call the `greeting` function and  
put in a name that you want the greeting  
function to include.

**02.** Press "Save & Submit Code" and see the  
function get into action! Saves you so much  
time.
