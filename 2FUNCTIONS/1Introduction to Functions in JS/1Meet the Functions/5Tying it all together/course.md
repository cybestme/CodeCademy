#Tying it all together
**Why** **is** **the** **code** **organized** **like** **it** **is** **on** **lines**  
**2-5?**

The computer can understand the code  
without such spacing. But it makes editing a  
lot easier and is best practice.  

####Do I have to put a semi-colon at the end of  
####each line of code in the reusable block?  
####And at the end of the entire function?

Yes. At the end of each line of code (within the  
`{ }`) and after the entire function (after the `{`  
`}`), please put a semi-colon. The semi-colon  
acts like a period in a sentence. It helps the  
computer know where there are stopping  
points in the code

##Instructions
A big part of programming is debugging. That  
just means figuring out what the heck went  
wrong with your code. Why didn't it run?

**01.** Look at line 9. It has many syntax errors.  
See how lack of spacing makes debugging  
hard?

**02.** Fix the function on line 9. Make sure the  
syntax is right. Make sure it looks nice.

**03.** Call the greeting function once it is fixed!  
Don't forget to pass in a specific name.
