#Introducing Functions
Programming is similar to baking cakes.  
Seriously! Imagine you are trying to teach  
your friend Jane how to bake many different  
types of cakes.

Each cake takes in different ingredients (ie.  
**inputs**). But the 'bake' instructions are always  
the same. For example:

**01.** Pre-heat the oven at 300 degrees

**02.** Mix all the ingredients in a bowl

**03.** Put contents into oven for 30 mins

And the **output** will be a different cake each  
time.

It is tedious to have to repeat to Jane the   
same 'bake' instructions every time. What if   
we could just say 'bake' and Jane would know  
to execute those three steps? That is exactly   
what a function is!

##Instructions

**01.** Line 3 declares the function and gives it a  
name.

**02.** Focus on line 4 and line 5. The code within  
the curly brackets `{ }` is the code we want to  
use again and again. (i.e. the 'bake'  
instructions)

**03.** Line 4 declares a variable called `val.` Line  
5 prints the value of that variable.

**04.** On line 8-11, we explain what** calling** a  
function means.

**05.** On line 12, replace the `6` with any  
number and press Save & Submit Code. Do  
this a few times to see the beauty of  
functions!
