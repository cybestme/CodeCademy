#While we're at it
Great work with `for` loops! As a reminder, `for` loop syntax looks like this:

    for (var i = start; i < end; i++) {
      // do something
    }

The counter variable `i` starts at "start", and stops looping when it reaches "end."

But what if you didn't know ahead of time when to stop looping? Say, for example, you wanted to keep choosing playing cards from a deck until you get a spade. You don't know how many cards you'll need to choose, so a `for` loop won't work.

In situations like these where you don't know in advance when to stop looping, we can use a `while` loop.

Don't worry about the `Math.floor` bit for nowâ€”we'll explain it soon!
