#What is programming?

Programming is like writing a list of   
instructions to the computer so it can do cool   
stuff with your information.

Programs can't yet make your bed, but they   
can do math, keep track of your bank  
account, or send a message to a friend.

To do any of these actions, the program   
needs an input. You can ask for input with a **prompt**.

###Examples:

1. `prompt("What is your name?");`
2. `prompt("What is Ubuntu?");`

##Instructions

Use the prompt command to ask the user   
where they are from. Check out the examples   
above for how to do this!

**Hint**（点开才有）  
Even tiny mistakes or typos can cause  
errors. Make sure to check that your   
punctuation is right and every opened  
bracket or brace is closed.
