#Modulo and if / else
So why learn modulo? For one thing, it's good  
at testing divisibility. Consider `30 % 1`0. What   
does it return? There is nothing left over, so `0`.

How about `9 % 3`? Also `0`.

We can use modulos in comparisons, like this:

—— `10 % 2 === 0` evaluates to `true`  

—— `7 % 3 === 0` evaluates to `false` because   
there is 1 left over.

##Instructions
Let's get the `if/else`" statement to display  
`"The first number is even"`.

**01.** Edit line 5 by adding a comparison that  
evaluates to `true`.

**02.** In the comparison, use a modulo and an  
even number, like we did in the example   
above
