#More practice with conditionals

Now let's practice using `if/else` statements.   
Do as much as you can by yourself, but if you

##Instructions
01.Write an `if/else` statement, just like we did  
in the last exercise. Here's what the outline of  
the code looked like:

    if (condition) 
    {
        // if condition is true
        // do this code
    }
    else // "otherwise"
    {
        // do this code instead
    }
    
02.If your condition is `true`, use `console.log` to  
print `"The condition is true"`.

03.Otherwise (else) when it is `false`,  
use `console.log` to print `"The condition is false"`.

04.Make sure your condition evaluates to `false`,   
so that your program prints out `"The condition is false"`.
