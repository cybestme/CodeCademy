#Declare your variables
We'll start by declaring the three variables we'll be using: `text`, `myName`, and `hits`.

Since `text` could be quite long, you can use a backslash `(\)` at the end of each line to make your string "wrap" to the next line, like this:

    var text = "Hey, how are you \
    doing? My name is Emily.";

In this way, using backlashes `(\)` is useful because you can avoid really long lines!

You can ignore the `/*jshint`... line for now. All that does is tell the console to stop worrying about our use of backslash characters for wrapping long lines of text.

##Instructions
Declare and set the following three variables:

**01.** `text`, and make it a string containing some text. Place your name in there a couple of times!

**02.** `myName`, and make it a string containing just your name.

**03.** `hits`, and make it an empty array.
