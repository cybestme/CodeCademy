#Controlling the for loop
We can now control where the `for` loop  
starts and ends. What about controlling what  
happens in between?

The examples we've looked at have used `i = ` 
`i + 1`. This has meant we have incremented  
(increased) the variable i by `1` each time.
###Rules to learn
a. A more efficient way to code to increment  
up by 1 is to write `i++`.  
b. We decrement down by 1 by writing `i--`.    
c. We can increment up by any value by  
writing `i += x`, where x is how much we want  
to increment up by. e.g., `i += 3` counts up by  
3s.  
d. We can decrement down by any value by  
writing `i -= x.` (See the Hint for more.)  
e. Be **very** careful with your syntaxâ€”if you  
write a loop that can't properly end, it's called  
an **infinite loop**. It will crash your browser!

##Instructions
**01.** This code counts every number from 0 to  
35.  
**02.** Make it start counting from 5. Please!  
**03.** Stop the counting when it prints out 50.  
**04.** Only count every fifth number. So we want to increment i by 5.
