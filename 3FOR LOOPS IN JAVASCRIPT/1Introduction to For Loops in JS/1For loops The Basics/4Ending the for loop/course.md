#Ending the for loop
We know how to control where the `for` loop  
starts. How do we control where it ends? Well,  
the second part of the `for` loop determines that.
###Syntax
    for (var i = 1; i < 11; i = i + 1) {
        code code code; 
    }
    
Here, this for loop will keep running until `i =`   
`10` ( i.e. while `i < 11)`. So when `i = 2`, or `i =`  
`9`, the for loop will run. But once `i` is no  
longer less than 11, the loop will stop.

##Instructions
**01.** We know this `for` loop counts from 1 to 10.

**02.** Change this `for` loop such that it starts at 4.

**03.** Change this `for` loop such that it counts  
up to and including 23. ( i.e. we do NOT want  
24 to be printed out!)

**04.** Run your `for` loop and see it count from 4 to 23!
