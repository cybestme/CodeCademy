#Starting the for loop
Congratulations! You've just run your first  
`for` loop. But what you're probably really  
keen to do is write your own `for` loop. Below  
is the general syntax of the `for` loop. We  
want to focus on the first line in the next few  
exercises.
###Syntax
    for (var i = 1; i < 11; i = i + 1) {
        /* your code here */;
    }

Every `for` loop makes use of a counting  
variable. Here, our variable is called `i` (but it  
can have any name). The variable has many  
roles. The first part of the for loop tells the  
computer to start with a value of 1 for `i`. It  
does this by declaring the variable called `i ` 
and giving it a value of `1`.

When the `for` loop executes the code in the  
code block—the bit between `{ }`—it does so  
by starting off where `i = 1`.

##Instructions
**01.** This `for` loop starts off at 1 and will end  
at 10.

**02.** Change the `for` loop such that it will start  
off at 5!
