#First for loop
Instead of manually typing in `console.log` five  
times, we can use a `for` loop to do this. The  
aim of this exercise is just to show you how a  
`for` loop looks, and demonstrate how useful  
it is. Subsequent exercises will

a. walk you through the syntax bit by bit  
b. explain how the computer thinks as it  
executes a `for` loop.

We initially focus on using `for` loops just to  
count numbers to keep things simple. But by  
section 3, we will show you how to do more  
fancy things!

##Instructions
**01.** The `for` loop in the code will print out 1 to  
5 and use far less code than you used in the  
previous exercise.

**02.** Change the 6 to 11 and press Save &  
Submit Code. This will see the computer print  
out 1 to 10!
