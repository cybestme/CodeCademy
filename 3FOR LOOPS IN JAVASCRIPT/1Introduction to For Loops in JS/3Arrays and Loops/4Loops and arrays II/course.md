#Loops and arrays II
It's time for you to write your own array and loop over the array. Remember to:

**01.** Put commas between each element in the array.

**02.** Put semi-colons between each bit of the `for` loop.

**03.** We suggest you use `i` as the iterator.

**04.** Beware of infinite loops!

**05.** Enjoy yourself while smashing through this coding!

##Instructions
**01.** Create an array called `names` filled with 5 names

**02.** Write a `for` loop that prints "`I know someone called` " followed by `names``[i]`. Make sure there's a space between "`called`" and the name!

**03.** Run your code and the five sentences should print out.
