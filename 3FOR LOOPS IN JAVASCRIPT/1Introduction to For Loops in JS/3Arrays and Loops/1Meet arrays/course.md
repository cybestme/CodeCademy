#Meet arrays
Variables can store numbers or strings. But so far, we've only been able to store ONE number or ONE string. Good thing we have arrays. Arrays:

a. store **lists** of data  
b. can store **different data types** at the same time  
c. are **ordered** so the position of each piece of data is fixed
###Example:
    var names = ["Mao","Gandhi","Mandela"];
    
    var sizes = [4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9];
    
    var mixed = [34, "candy", "blue", 11];
##Syntax:
    var arrayName = [data, data, data];

Any time you see data surrounded by `[ ]`, it is an array.

##Instructions
Make your own array called `junk`. Put 4 bits of data in it (first 2 strings, then 2 numbers).

**01.** Declare it using `var`.

**02.** Put `[ ]` around your data.

**03.** Separate each bit of data with a comma.

**04.** End it with a semi-colon.

**05.** Use `console.log` to print out `junk`.
