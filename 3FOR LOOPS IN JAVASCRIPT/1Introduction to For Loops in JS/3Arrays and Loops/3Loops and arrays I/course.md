#Loops and arrays I
Awesome job! You've now learned about arrays, and how to access one element of the array. But what if there were 100 elements in the array?

For arrays, a useful way to systematically access every element in the array is to use a `for` loop!
###How does it work?

1. Line 3 declares the array. It has 4 elements.    
1. We then start the `for` loop on line 5.
1. We see `i` starts off at value 0. 
1. The `for` loop runs until `i < 4` (because `cities.length` equals 4. The array cities has 4 elements in it; see the Hint for more.)
1. We will increment `i` by 1 each time we loop over.
1. We print out `cities[0]`, which is `"Melbourne"`.
1.  We then start the loop again. Except now `i = 1`. 
1.  It will print out `cities[1]`, which is `"Amman"`.
1.  This continues until `i` is no longer less than `cities.length`.

##Instructions
**01.** Change the elements in the `cities` array. You can put in as many elements as you like.

**02.** Run the `for` loop and see them all printed out!
