#How does it work?
We've gone through the three bits of syntax  
for a `for` loop. But how exactly does it work?  
Let's imagine the steps the computer takes to  
run the `for` loop on the right.

**01.** It starts off with `i = 2`

**02.** It then asks: Is `i` currently less than 13?  
Because `i = 2`, this is true and we continue.

**03.** We do NOT increment now. Instead, if the   
condition is met, we run the code block.

**04.** Here, the code block prints out the value  
of `i`. It is currently 2 so 2 will be printed out.

**05.** Once the code block is finished, the `for`  
loop then increments / decrements. Here, we  
add 1.

**06.** Now `i = 3`. We check if it is less than 13. If  
it is true, we run the code block.

**07.** The code block runs, and then we  
increment.

**08.** We repeat these steps until the condition  
`i < 13` is no longer true.

##Instructions
**01.** Make the computer start counting at 8.

**02.** Keep counting while `i < 120`.

**03.** Count up by increments of 12.

Remember, if you accidentally make a loop  
that never ends, your browser will crash!
