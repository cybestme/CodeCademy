#Last practice for loop
You have a great handle on `for` loops now! This will be the last practice one before we look at cool ways to use them.

The next exercise introduces you to arrays. So instead of just counting numbers up and down, we can make the computer do many more interesting things with loops.

##Instructions
Once more, for practice: write a `for` loop that gets the computer to count down from 100 until 0 by 5. This time, make sure not to print 0.
